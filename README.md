# Sneak-Water-Gun_Game
 The Sneak-Water-Gun Game is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user selects Sneak, Gun, or Water, and the computer randomly selects a choice. The comparison is made: if the user selects Sneak and the computer guesses Gun, then Gun shoots Sneak, and the computer wins while you lose. Similarly, if both select the same option, then it's a tie.
